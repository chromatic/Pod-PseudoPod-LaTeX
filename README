NAME
    Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX - convert Pod::PseudoPod documents into LaTeX

SYNOPSIS
    This module is a Pod::PseudoPod subclass, itself a Pod::Simple subclass.
    This means that this is a full-fledged POD parser. Anything those
    modules can do, this can do.

    Perhaps a little code snippet.

        use Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX;

        my $parser = Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX->new();
            $parser->emit_environments( sidebar => 'sidebar' );
        $parser->output_fh( $some_fh );
        $parser->parse_file( 'some_document.pod' );

        ...

LATEX PRELUDE
    The generated LaTeX code needs some packages to be loaded to work
    correctly. Currently it needs

        \usepackage{fancyvrb}  % for Screen and Verbatim environments
        \usepackage{url}       % for L<> URLs
        \usepackage{titleref}  % for A<> generated code

    The standard font in LaTeX (Computer Modern) does not support bold and
    italic variants of its monospace font, an alternative is

        \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
        \usepackage{textcomp}
        \usepackage[scaled]{beramono}

MODULE OPTIONS
    Currently we support:

    "keep_ligatures"
        LaTeX usually joins some pair of letters (ff, fi and fl), named
        ligatures. By default the module split thems. If you prefer to
        render them with ligatures, use:

          my $parser = Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX->new( keep_ligatures => 1 );

STYLES / EMITTING ENVIRONMENTS
    The "emit_environments" method accepts a hashref whose keys are POD
    environments and values are latex environments. Use this method if you
    would like "Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX" to emit a simple
    "\begin{foo}...\end{foo}" environment rather than emit specific
    formatting codes. You must define any environemtns you use in this way
    in your latex prelude.

    You can define your own environments easily. First you need to define
    the "=begin...=end" environment with:

      $parser->acept_target_as_text('my_environment');

    Then, you can use the "emit_environments" method to tell
    "Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX" what LaTeX environment to emit:

      $parser->emit_environments('my_environment' => 'latex_env');

    Also, if "my_environment" is used in POD with a title, it is passed as
    the first argument to the LaTeX environment. That is,

      =begin my_environment Some title

    Will generate

      \begin{latex_env}{Some title}

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS and SEE ALSO
    Based on Allison Randal's Pod::PseudoPod module.

    See also perlpod, Pod::Simple and Pod::TeX. I did not reuse the latter
    because I need to support the additional POD directives found in
    PseudoPod.
